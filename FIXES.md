## How to Resolve the Network Error

The "Network Error" you were experiencing is most likely due to one of these issues:

1. **Backend Server Not Running**
   - Solution: Use the `start_backend.bat` script to run the server
   - Verification: The script now checks PostgreSQL connection and port availability

2. **Database Connection Issue**
   - Solution: Make sure PostgreSQL is running and the budget_db exists
   - Verification: The diagnostic script checks this automatically

3. **Port Conflict**
   - Solution: Check if anything else is using port 6543
   - Verification: Both scripts now check for port conflicts

4. **CORS Issues**
   - Solution: CORS headers are now properly set in the backend app

## How to Use the New Tools

1. **To Start Everything Properly**:
   ```powershell
   ./start_app.ps1
   ```

2. **To Diagnose Problems**:
   ```powershell
   ./diagnose-backend.ps1
   ```

3. **To Test API Directly**:
   Open `backend-test.html` in a web browser

## Additional Recommendations

1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running before starting the application
2. If errors persist, check the browser console for detailed error messages
3. Make sure both frontend and backend are running on their expected ports
4. Use the NetworkStatusCheck component for real-time connectivity status
