# Data Persistence Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified
POST requests to `/api/categories` were successful (returning status 200 and category IDs), but the created categories were not appearing in subsequent GET requests. This indicated a database session isolation issue.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by improper database session management:
1. **Session Isolation**: Different requests were getting different database sessions without proper coordination
2. **Transaction Boundaries**: Sessions weren't being properly cleaned up between requests
3. **Session Configuration**: The DBSession was configured with default settings that didn't ensure proper isolation

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Database Session Configuration
**File**: `backend/app/models/__init__.py`

**Before**:
```python
DBSession = scoped_session(sessionmaker(expire_on_commit=False))
```

**After**:
```python
DBSession = scoped_session(sessionmaker(
    expire_on_commit=False,
    autoflush=True,
    autocommit=False
))
```

**Impact**: Better session control with explicit flush and commit behavior.

### 2. Proper Session Cleanup in GET Endpoint
**File**: `backend/app/views/category_api.py`

**Before**:
```python
@view_config(route_name='get_categories', renderer='json', request_method='GET')
def get_categories(request):
    try:
        # Ensure we have a fresh session
        DBSession.expire_all()
        categories = DBSession.query(Category).all()
        # ... rest of function
```

**After**:
```python
@view_config(route_name='get_categories', renderer='json', request_method='GET')
def get_categories(request):
    try:
        # Remove the session and create a fresh query
        DBSession.remove()
        categories = DBSession.query(Category).all()
        # ... rest of function
```

**Impact**: Ensures each GET request starts with a completely fresh database session.

### 3. Enhanced POST Endpoint with Proper Transaction Management
**File**: `backend/app/views/category_api.py`

**Key Changes**:
1. **Session cleanup before operation**: `DBSession.remove()` at start
2. **Explicit flush before commit**: `DBSession.flush()` to ensure ID assignment
3. **Session cleanup after operation**: `DBSession.remove()` after commit
4. **Better error handling**: Cleanup sessions in exception handlers

**Before**:
```python
# Create new category with simplified transaction handling
new_cat = Category(nama=data.get('nama'))
DBSession.add(new_cat)
DBSession.commit()
```

**After**:
```python
# Remove any existing session to ensure clean state
DBSession.remove()

new_cat = Category(nama=data.get('nama'))
DBSession.add(new_cat)

# Flush to get ID without committing
DBSession.flush()
DBSession.commit()

# Force session removal to ensure other requests see the changes
DBSession.remove()
```

### 4. Consistent Session Management for All Operations
Applied the same session cleanup pattern to:
- `update_category()` function
- `delete_category()` function

Each operation now follows the pattern:
1. Clean session at start (`DBSession.remove()`)
2. Perform operation
3. Commit changes
4. Clean session at end (`DBSession.remove()`)

## Expected Results

With these fixes, the data persistence issue should be resolved:

1. **POST requests** will successfully create categories AND ensure they're visible to other requests
2. **GET requests** will always fetch fresh data from the database
3. **Session isolation** will prevent one request from interfering with another
4. **Transaction boundaries** will be properly maintained

## Testing Instructions

To verify the fix works:

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   .\env\Scripts\activate
   python -m waitress --port=6543 --call app:main
   ```

2. Test the endpoints:
   ```bash
   # Get initial categories
   curl http://localhost:6543/api/categories
   
   # Add a new category
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"nama":"Test Category"}' http://localhost:6543/api/categories
   
   # Get categories again (should include the new one)
   curl http://localhost:6543/api/categories
   ```

3. Expected result: The new category should appear in the second GET request.

## Technical Details

The fix addresses the core issue of **database session scoping** in web applications. In a multi-request environment, each request needs its own isolated database session to prevent:

- **Dirty reads**: One request seeing uncommitted changes from another
- **Lost updates**: Changes being overwritten by concurrent requests  
- **Session leakage**: Old session state affecting new requests

The `DBSession.remove()` calls ensure that each request gets a fresh session from the connection pool, while proper transaction boundaries (`flush()` + `commit()`) ensure changes are persisted correctly.

## Status: âœ… IMPLEMENTED

All persistence-related fixes have been applied. The backend should now correctly handle category creation and retrieval with proper data persistence.
